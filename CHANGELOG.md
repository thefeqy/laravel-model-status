## v1.5.0 - 2025-03-04

#### New Features

- **Status Casting (`StatusCast`)**
  
  - The `status` field is now automatically cast to a `Status` object.
  - Allows method calls like `$model->status->isActive()` and `$model->status->isInactive()`.
  - Ensures better type safety when working with statuses.
  
- **Cascade Deactivation**
  
  - When a model is deactivated, related models can also be automatically deactivated.
  - Introduced `$cascadeDeactivate` property to define related models that should also be deactivated.
  - Example:
    ```php
    class Category extends Model
    {
        use HasActiveScope;
    
        protected array $cascadeDeactivate = ['products'];
    
        public function products()
        {
            return $this->hasMany(Product::class);
        }
    }
    
    ```
  - Calling `$category->deactivate();` will also deactivate all associated products.
